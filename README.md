# ReynbOS

This is the public and Official repository for the ReynbOS distro,
a lot of work is being done configuring it at the moment, so more information will follow.

# Basic
ReynbOS is a debian based distro with emphasis on script first mindset,
recipes will be added later, but you'll have a basic distro with an i3 window manager,
firefox, vscode, drivers, utilites and system tools.

As this is a live distrobution we need a release schedule, which will be put up soon using github actions
to get a CI integration going for weekly updates.
